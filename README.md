# Parkinson's disease prediction using Neural networks
 Parkinson's disease prediction using MRI scan, Spiral image and Voice data, with neural network and website deployment with django.

## Introduction

-> Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement.

-> It is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra, which is responsible for controlling movement.

-> As a result, people with Parkinson's disease may experience a wide range of symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and difficulty with balance and coordination.

-> Parkinson's disease is caused over the age of 50, but it can occur in younger individuals as well.

-> There is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, but treatments are available to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

-> These may include medications, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, as well as physical therapy and deep brain stimulation.

## Objective

The development of a deep learning model for Parkinson's disease diagnosis using MRI scans, spiral image and voice signal can have several benefits.

-> It can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, which can lead to earlier detection and treatment of the disease.

-> It can provide valuable insights into the underlying biology of the disease and help identify new targets for treatment.

-> It can facilitate the development of personalized treatment plans for patients with Parkinson's disease.
